Lights Out with a focus on Linear Algebra

Explored the classic game Lights Out using linear algebra to model the grid as a system of equations, where button presses correspond to vectors. Solvable configurations were identified by analyzing the null space and column space of the toggle matrix, and algorithmic strategies like divide-and-conquer and binary enumeration were applied to find solutions.

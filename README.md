# MATH401 – Applications of Linear Algebra (University of Maryland)

This repository contains my final project for MATH401, which explores the “Lights Out” puzzle through the lens of linear algebra.

## 🎲 Final Project: Linear Algebra and "Lights Out"

- **Overview:**
  - Analyzes the electronic puzzle “Lights Out,” linking the puzzle’s mechanics to concepts in linear algebra.
  - Models the game using matrices and vector spaces, determines solvability conditions, and examines patterns within solution spaces.
  - Explores how actions in the game can be interpreted as binary operations and system solutions in $$\mathbb{Z}_2$$ or $$\mathbb{Z}_p$$.
- **Major Themes & Topics:**
  - Matrix representation of puzzles and toggle effects
  - Null space, column space, and conditions for winnability
  - Strategies: Row reduction, divide-and-conquer, and binary counting
  - Extensions to larger boards, multiple states, higher dimensions, and real-world analogies (electrical grids, social networks, biology)
  - Reflections on the scope of linear algebra in game theory and mathematical modeling
- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Applied matrix operations, row reduction, and finding null spaces
  - Connected abstract math concepts to games, algorithms, and broader applications
  - Advanced written exposition and curiosity-driven exploration
